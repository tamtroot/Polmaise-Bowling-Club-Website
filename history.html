                <p class="intro-text">From humble beginnings in a mining village to becoming one of Scotland's premier bowling clubs, Polmaise Bowling Club's story is one of community spirit, sporting excellence, and enduring tradition. Founded in 1911 with funds from the local Gothenburg pub, our club has weathered world wars, economic changes, and social transformation while maintaining its position at the heart of Fallin's community life.</p>

                    <div class="content">
                        <p>Fallin's story begins with coal. In the 1890s, the Polmaise estate owned by the Murray family revealed rich coal seams, prompting the Alloa Coal Company to purchase the land and sink two collieries by 1902. A mining village sprang up as workers and their families arrived, with the coal industry providing homes, a new school built in 1907 to educate 200 children, and even a church erected in 1908.</p>
                        
                        <p>As the village took shape around the pit, one thing it lacked was a local pub – miners seeking a drink had to trek three miles into Stirling on foot or by horse-drawn cart. This changed on <strong>4 November 1910</strong> with the opening of <strong>The Gothenburg</strong> (fondly nicknamed "The Goth"), a public house established under the enlightened Gothenburg system.</p>
                        
                        <p>Under this system – imported from Sweden – only a 5% dividend went to shareholders, while at least 95% of pub profits were reinvested into the community. The Gothenburg system's focus on temperance and community welfare fit well in this tight-knit mining village, providing much-needed facilities and funding everything from street lighting to social clubs.</p>

                <div class="history-block">
                    <div class="year-marker">1911</div>
                    <div class="content">
                        <p>In late 1910, as Fallin's miners enjoyed their new pub, community leaders began planning a recreational outlet that would offer healthy, sociable competition. The founding committee of the Fallin Public House Society included several avid lawn bowlers, so it's perhaps no surprise that the very first project financed by The Goth's profits was the construction of a bowling green adjacent to the pub.</p>
                        
                        <p>In early 1911, a public meeting of villagers – with backing from the pub and the colliery owners – decided to establish a bowling club. According to club lore, the organizers even debated whether to build a swimming pond or a bowling green, ultimately choosing the bowling club as the village's new sporting facility.</p>

                            <p><strong>Polmaise Bowling Club was formally founded in 1911, kickstarted by a generous £286 donation from The Gothenburg pub's profits.</strong></p>
                        </div>
                        
                        <p>The club's first committee was composed largely of local miners, with Major Murray of Polmaise (the local laird) and Mr. Jackson Russell of the colliery company serving as Honorary Presidents. Leading the club was its first President, <strong>Mr. D. Todd</strong> (a miner), alongside Vice-President J. Barr, Secretary D. Blythe, and Treasurer A. Kerr.</p>

                        <p>The grand opening of the bowling green took place in June 1911 and was a festive affair for the whole village. A "Sale of Work" and gala day were organized on <strong>3 June 1911</strong> to celebrate the opening, raising additional funds and marking the club's birth with due ceremony.</p>
                        
                        <p>A few weeks later, on <strong>Wednesday 12 July 1911</strong>, Polmaise Bowling Club hosted its first-ever match. Five rinks from the nearby Spittalmyre Bowling Club visited Fallin for a friendly inaugural game on the new green. Polmaise's novices were defeated in that maiden encounter, but by all accounts the match was played in great spirit.</p>

                        <p>From its earliest years, Polmaise Bowling Club became a focal point of community life in Fallin. Membership grew quickly among the miners; although the club began with only around 30 members, they were a dedicated group who practiced diligently on their well-tended green.</p>
                        
                        <p>Polmaise's bowlers wasted no time making a name for themselves. By <strong>1914</strong> – just three years after founding – the club had captured its first trophy, winning a tournament in emphatic fashion by 101 shots to 61. Over the following decade, Polmaise bowlers shocked larger clubs by winning nearly every Stirlingshire cup they contested.</p>

                            <p><strong>John "Jock" Gwynne Snr.</strong> became a club legend, winning nine Polmaise club championships with his first title coming in 1913. This extraordinary feat set a record for the club that stood for generations.</p>

                        <p>In <strong>1935</strong>, Polmaise achieved a notable milestone by winning the prestigious <strong>MacIntosh Trophy</strong> outright – earning permanent ownership of the cup after a nail-biting victory over Bridge of Allan Bowling Club.</p>

                        <p>The outbreak of World War II in 1939 brought new challenges to Polmaise Bowling Club. Competitive bowling was curtailed during the war, with club records showing no official activity in 1939, and several members left to serve in the armed forces.</p>
                        
                        <p>Nevertheless, those who remained kept the spirit of the club alive. In <strong>1942</strong>, an extraordinary club championship final saw John Gwynne Snr. face his own son on the Polmaise green – a father-versus-son showdown for the title. The senior Gwynne, then in his 60s, managed to defeat his son, claiming his last club championship.</p>

The highlight was a grand Jubilee exhibition match on <strong>Tuesday, June 6, 1961</strong>, featuring the President of the Scottish Bowling Association and the reigning British Isles champions from Kirkcaldy.</p>

                    <p>From a humble miners' green funded by pub pennies to a powerhouse of Scottish bowls, Polmaise Bowling Club's journey mirrors the story of Fallin itself.

                    <p>Polmaise has always been more than just a place to play bowls – it is a social institution built on camaraderie, sportsmanship, and local pride. Generations of Fallin residents have forged friendships and memories on its green, making it a cornerstone of the village's identity.</p>
                    
                    <p>As the club moves forward, it does so with a deep respect for its history and a commitment to future generations. Polmaise Bowling Club stands today, after well over 100 years, as a living legacy of community spirit – proof that from the synergy of a pub's generosity and a village's determination can grow a lasting tradition of sporting excellence and fellowship.</p>
