                            <p>On Tuesday 3rd June, Polmaise Bowling Club proudly hosted two enthusiastic groups of children from Fallin Primary School as part of Active Stirling's Try Bowls initiative. Across two sessions, one in the morning and another in the early afternoon, around 40 pupils took part in a fun and engaging introduction to the sport of lawn bowls.</p>
                            
                            <p>The event marked another successful collaboration between the club, Fallin Primary School, and Active Stirling, aimed at promoting physical activity and encouraging young people to try new sports within their community.</p>
                            
                            <p>Volunteers John McKenna and Lawrence Begg, both long-standing members of the club, led the sessions, offering coaching, encouragement, and plenty of support throughout the day. Their commitment and enthusiasm were instrumental in ensuring the children had a rewarding experience on the green.</p>
                            
                            <p>Club Secretary Peter Black, who played a key role in organising the sessions, extended his thanks to John and Lawrence for their efforts not only this year, but across both seasons the club has worked with Fallin Primary and Active Stirling on the Try Bowls Days.</p>
                            
                            <p>Each child who participated received a specially designed certificate from Polmaise Bowling Club, recognising their involvement and celebrating their first steps into the sport.</p>
                            
                            <p>Polmaise Bowling Club continues to support initiatives like this, which bring together generations and strengthen community ties through sport.</p>

                            <p>Polmaise Bowling Club is proudly celebrating the exceptional achievements of its youngest adult member, Kyle Malcomson, whose talent and dedication to the sport have earned him significant recognition on the national stage.</p>
                            
                            <p>Kyle has recently been selected to represent Stirlingshire in the Scottish Under 25 County Championships, a prestigious tournament that showcases the very best young talent in the country. He will compete as part of Team 6 in the Stirlingshire U25 squad facing Renfrewshire U25s on Sunday, 1st June at 2pm, hosted at Denny Bowling Club. This marks a major milestone in Kyle's bowling career and reflects his ongoing commitment and hard work both on and off the green.</p>
                            
                            <p>Adding to his string of recent successes, Kyle delivered a phenomenal performance at the Podium Open Triples event held on Saturday, 17th May. Going head-to-head with some of Scotland's top talent, Kyle defeated Neil Spears, a highly respected former Scotland captain and current skip. His victory not only showcased his strategic prowess and composure under pressure but also secured him a place at the national finals in Ayr on 7th June.</p>

                                "Kyle has just beaten two Scotland skips – an incredible achievement at any level, let alone at his age," said Dave Stewart, club Vice-President and long-time supporter. "His success is a testament to the talent we nurture at Polmaise and to Kyle's passion for the game. The entire club is behind him, and we couldn't be prouder."

                            <p>This remarkable journey is not just a solo effort—it is part of a family legacy. Kyle's father, Gary Malcomson, shared his pride:</p>

                                "As father and son, we won back-to-back Singles and U25 Central titles in 2024 and 2025. A record I don't think can be beaten."
                            </blockquote>
                            
                            <p>Together, the Malcomsons have etched their names into the history books of Central District bowling, blending generational skill with shared determination.</p>
                            
                            <p>Kyle's back-to-back achievements highlight him as a future star of the sport. As the youngest adult player at Polmaise, his progress serves as an inspiration to fellow members and young players across the region.</p>
                            
                            <p>The Polmaise community is encouraged to come out and support Kyle and the Stirlingshire team at Denny Bowling Club this weekend. Let's get behind our local talent and show what the Polmaise spirit is all about.</p>
                            
                            <p>Well done, Kyle — your club and your county are proud of you!</p>

                            <p>The striking red and white shirt, presented during David's visit to the club, features the signatures of several legendary figures in Scottish bowls. Alongside David Gourlay's signature are those of Paul Foster MBE, Alex Marshall MBE, Stuart Anderson, and Darren Burnett—all renowned champions on both the national and international stage.</p></br>

                               <p>Tucked away in a corner of our clubhouse is a framed treasure — a collection of yellowed clippings and fading type, lovingly preserved and gifted to Polmaise Bowling Club by W. Jenkins on the occasion of our 75th Anniversary in July 1986. These articles, drawn from newspapers and community reports, tell the quiet but proud story of our club — of roll-ups and rivalries, of jubilee celebrations, gala days, and the steadfast spirit of Fallin's bowling men and women.</p>
                               
                               <p>Thanks to a recent rediscovery, our journey now stretches all the way back to where it all began — with a news article from 1911, capturing the excitement and ceremony of Polmaise Bowling Club's official opening. This first recorded moment on our green sets the stage for over a century of camaraderie, competition, and community.</p>
                               
                               <p>In this special News series, we'll be gently dusting off the past and sharing those moments once more — not as grand headlines, but as living memories. Each article is a snapshot in time: a nod to the suits and hats, the handshakes and speeches, the summer days on the green, and the laughter echoing from the clubhouse.</p>

                                    <p>Peter Black shared some of his memories from the 75th Anniversary:</p>
                                    
                                    <p>"I was President when we celebrated our 75th anniversary. On the Monday night, we invited every club we played tea games with to send a rink to play against us. Then, on Tuesday, we hosted a match against a Central Select team, followed by the County Select on Wednesday, and the Scottish on Thursday. Friday was a hat night with our own club members.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>After each game, the highest-scoring rink from each team was presented with a silver goblet. We also invited past Presidents to attend, and one of them even read a poem about Polmaise during the tea.</p>
                                    
                                    <p>I remember the Monday night against the tea games well—I was told I left F.P.H.S. around 9:30, only to be back at the bar by 9:40 asking for a pint and a vodka! I was just a boy of 36."</p>

                                        <p>With first Johnstone displacing it and then Logie eventually ditching the jack to lie shot, Polmaise stood on the brink of victory for the next few agonising minutes.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Unaccountably, English skip Greg Moon failed to reach the target with his final three deliveries and proud Polmaise were home and dry at 19-18.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Elsewhere in the championships, singles man Darren Burnett scored a 21-20 victory over England's Martin Sekjer, while Scotland's junior singles and fours both lost in their finals.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>The Polmaise success was the first-ever British title won by an SBA Stirling district club. The only other Stirlingshire success came in 1966 when Denny's Andrew Cruickshank, Jim Logan, John Bradbury and Jim Adams won the British Isles fours.</p>

                                            <p><em>Historical Note: This remarkable victory in 2003 marked a significant milestone in Polmaise's history as the first club from the SBA Stirling district to win a British Isles title. The dramatic comeback from being 10-1 down early in the match to forcing an extra end, and then securing victory in such nail-biting fashion, made this achievement even more memorable. This win not only brought prestigious recognition to Polmaise but also helped Scotland secure the NatWest Trophy as the best overall nation in the championships.</em></p>

                                        <p><strong>SCOTTISH silverware was being flaunted in Fallin last Saturday evening.</strong></p>
                                        
                                        <p>The celebrations followed the magnificent achievement of three Polmaise bowlers becoming national champions.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>John Johnstone, Derek Logie and Jason Williams were the men who sealed triples victory - in some considerable style - over Fauldhouse in a thrilling final encounter earlier in the day at Ayr's Northfield greens.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>After seeing off the defending champions in the morning semi-final, they went on to stage a dramatic last end assault in the final to snatch victory.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Replay</h4>
                                        
                                        <p>Two shots adrift of the West Lothian trio playing final end and with a match-winning lie against him, Polmaise skip Williams managed to burn the end with his first bowl, forcing a replay!</p>
                                        
                                        <p>On that subsequent end, Polmaise scored the required three shots with Johnstone, Logie and Williams each contributing to the all important count which survived a last bowl attack by Fauldhouse skip Francis.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Victory by 18 shots to 12 had given the Polmaise Club their first ever success at the national championships and provided the Stirling area with their first Scottish mens' winners since 1967 when Gary Craig took the junior title.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>It was also the Stirling area's first success in the Scottish Triples since the event was introduced by the Scottish Bowling Association in 1971.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>On their run to victory, Polmaise had overcome Edinburgh West End (19-9), St Rollox (22-4), Bogleha' (15-7) and last year's champions Chirnside (17-13) in the semi-final.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>"To be honest, becoming Scottish triples champions hasn't quite sunk in yet," admitted an obviously elated skip Jason last Saturday evening - still on cloud nine after his team's magnificent three-day Ayr raid to capture the Cockburn trophy.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>But worthy Scottish champions they are - and John, Derek and Jason are to be congratulated for turning in some top class performances throughout the championships and in bringing national glory to the Stirling area.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Challenges</h4>
                                        
                                        <p>Further challenges now lie ahead for the new Scottish champions who will fly the flag for their country in next year's British Isles championships being played on familiar territory - Ayr Northfield.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>This year's national championship proved to be probably the best ever for District Nine bowlers.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Apart from the Polmaise triples' success, quarter-final placings were achieved in no less than three other events.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>The Polmaise four of Alex McNeil, Mark Bone, Peter Black and Sandy Deans enjoyed victories over Helensburgh (24-13) and Keltybridge (18-8) before being edged out 16-17 by Blackwood Victoria in the last eight line-up.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Singles man David Stewart from Spittalmyre also made the last eight with wins over Burnhead's Keith Munn (21-11) and C Crawford from Castlehill Colliery (21-16).</p>
                                        
                                        <p>David then lost out to former champion John Mitchell (Kirkintilloch) 9-21.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>In the junior singles, Doune Castle's David Cronie won his opening encounter against Linwood's G Sadler (21-15), before seeing off Parkside's K Storf.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>However in his quarter-final match with Andrew Lauder from Lockerbie, David lost by the narrowest of margins (20-21).</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Dunblane's Steven Eddie and Neal Nairn made an early exit in the pairs, losing 11-18 to Longside, and likewise in the senior fours where Doune Castle bowlers Hugh Reid, Tam Muirhead, Sandy McIntosh and David Lauder went down 11-18 to Rothesay.</p>

                                            <p><em>Historical Note: This momentous victory in 2002 marked Polmaise Bowling Club's first national championship success, breaking a long drought for the Stirling area that stretched back to 1967. The dramatic fashion of the win - with skip Jason Williams burning the end when two shots down, then securing the three shots needed on the replay - demonstrated the skill and nerves of steel possessed by the Polmaise trio. This Scottish title also qualified the team for the 2003 British Isles Championships, where they would go on to achieve even greater glory.</em></p>

                                        <p>This is a memorable week for the mining village of Fallin for the Polmaise Bowling Club are celebrating their golden jubilee and doing it in real royal fashion. After an enjoyable mixed game on Monday night, the club had as guests on Tuesday night the President of the Scottish Bowling Association, Mr David Preston, Stirling, and the members of the S.B.A. Council, together with the British Isles championship rink from Kirkcaldy skipped by Mr R. Whitehead.</p>
                                        <p>A keen game on the excellent green resulted in a draw of 68 shots each, after which the company sat down to supper in the lounge of the Gothenburg. There the guests were given a warm welcome by the president, Mr William Paterson, now in his eighth year of office, and in the party at the top table were Mr Preston ; Mr John Linning, secretary of the S.B.A. : Mr Tom Corrie, secretary of Stirling County Bowling Association; Mr Tom Bunyan, that grand old man of the Polmaise Club now resident in Perthshire ; Mr Robert Dick, vice-president ; Mr .Pat. Lyons, secretary, and Mr John Brown, treasurer, the oldest playing member of the club. He joined in 1912.</p>
                                        <p>Mr Preston proposed a toast to the club, and after the secretary had the scores Mr. Paterson presented prizes to the members of the highest-up rink on each side. Referring to the auspicious occasion they were celebrating, Mr Paterson said that had been an outstanding night in the history of Polmaise Club and paid tribute to the Gothenburg for rallying round them to make the celebrations a success.</p>
                                        <p>Mr Preston at the outset of a racy speech thanked the British Isles championship rink for coming all the way from Lochgelly to help out the Scottish on this important occasion. It was a great joy to him, he said, to be among his ain folk that night He had known the Polmaise Club for many years and he thanked them for their co-operation over the past 15 years.</p>
                                        <p>Polmaise was born in 1911. It was one of the small clubs, but, strange to say, they had won every cup they had competed for in the County of Stirling. They had only a member-ship of around 30, but with the help of the "Goth" had never allowed the surface of their fine green to deteriorate.</p>
                                        <p>When The club started the membership fee was 6/ -. After the second world war they raised it to 10/- and now be believed it was £1.</p>
                                        <p>He could not, therefore, understand why more of the men folk of Fallin did not support the club in the way fit so richly deserved. They were missing a great opportunity of enjoying life to the full on the bowling green and taking part in the greatest sport in the world. Polmaise Club, said Mr Preston. had been four times to Queen's Park. They had also the rather peculiar distinction of having had only six presidents in their lifetime of 50 years. They must like to keep good men on the job, and " Willie" Paterson, now doing his eighth year, was also doing a very good job. He thanked the club for their kind invitation and for their generous hospitality, and wished them a very successful week and much success in the future.</p>
                                        <p>Mr Paterson briefly acknowledged the Scottish president's remarks. Mr Tom Bunyan said he felt it an honour to have been asked to thank the "Scottish" for their presence and it had been a pleasure to see them enjoy themselves on laughable. The Scottish was a wonderful organisation and its affairs were well handled by Secretary Linning. It was a great honour to Polmaise to have the British Isles championship rink with them on this occasion. It was also a very nice gesture on the part of the Scottish Council members to present badges to the Polmaise players. He assured them they would be much appreciated by those who received them.</p>
                                        <p>Mr John Linning, the Scottish secretary, added a word of congratulation to the club and said how much they appreciated the way Mr Preston was carrying out his duties as president. He also mentioned that this year they had a record entry for the Scottish championships. Out of the 772 clubs. 741 had entered the rink competition, 735 the singles and 734 the pairs. It was amazing, he said, to see such interest in the game.</p>

John Gwynne Sr. was a dominant force in the club during the 1920s-40s, with this victory marking his ninth and final club championship. What makes this match particularly special is that he faced his own son in the final, showing how bowling had become a family tradition at Polmaise.

                                        <p>Polmaise and Bridge of Allan Bowling Clubs met in a four-rink game at Spittalmyre green on Saturday to decide the ownership of the Macintosh Trophy. Presented by Provost Macintosh for competition among clubs of the Stirling and District Bowling League the Cup has been won three times by both clubs during its ten years' existence.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>The final game on Saturday was played in accordance with the rule that the Cup should become the property of the club to win it the greatest number of times. The game was very close, and before the last rink came in only 1 shot separated the clubs. Polmaise, however, finished strongly to win by 4 shots.</p>

                                            <p><em>Historical Note: This victory was particularly significant as it granted Polmaise permanent ownership of the prestigious Macintosh Trophy. After a decade of competition between clubs in the Stirling and District Bowling League, both Polmaise and Bridge of Allan had won the cup three times each. This final, decisive match—with its nail-biting finish where Polmaise came from behind to win by just 4 shots—determined that the trophy would remain forever at Fallin. The match featured some of the club's most notable players, including J. Gwynne Sr. and Jr., who would later face each other in the famous 1942 club championship final.</em></p>

The "youngest combination in the competition" showed their developing skill by defeating more established clubs from Cowie, Cambusbarron, and Borestone with a substantial 40-shot margin. This achievement laid the foundation for many future successes and helped establish Polmaise as a competitive force in local bowling.</em></p>

                                        <p>On Wednesday evening five rinks from the Spittalmyre Bowling Club visited Polmaise Bowling Club, when a most enjoyable game was contested, which ended in a victory for Spittalmyre with 32 shots up, the scores being :- Spittalmyre,106; Polmaise, 72.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>At the close of the game the president of the local club, Mr Todd, said that it gave them great pleasure to have their old friends from Spittalmyre at their first match on the Fallin green, and when he saw the visitors with so many veterans in their midst, he was not so surprised at the victory. He hoped, however, that Polmaise would yet be able to alter the figures.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>In reply, the vice-president of Spittalmyre, Mr George Liddle, said it was unfortunate that their president, Mr W Porter, was unavoidably absent, as he considered this to be a very important match. However, on behalf of the Spittalmyre club and himself he thanked the president, Mr Todd, and the Polmaise club for their kind invitation that evening. They had thoroughly enjoyed the game and the hospitality of the Fallin club, and in his opinion the green was in excellent order, and reflected the greatest credit on the parties responsible for its institution.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>He, of course, was also delighted at the victory for Spittalmyre, but greater than the victory was the good feeling and friendly spirit which existed all through the game, and he hoped that these estimable traits would continue amongst them. He had much pleasure in asking for three hearty cheers for the Fallin club members, and three cheers for their president, Mr Todd. (Cheers.)</p>

Despite the defeat, the gracious sportsmanship shown by both clubs set the tone for what would become a century-long tradition of friendly competition. President Todd's optimistic prediction that "Polmaise would yet be able to alter the figures" would prove prophetic, as the club went on to achieve numerous successes in the years to come, beginning with their first trophy win in 1914.</em></p>

                                        <p>Saturday last was a great day at the mining village of Fallin, three miles from Stirling, the occasion being the opening of a bowling green and a sale of work, both these events being the first of the kind in the village. The weather was beautiful, and when Mr Horne, K.C., Edinburgh, the Unionist candidate for the County at the last election, turned up and performed both opening ceremonies, there was a very large audience collected round the fence of the new bowling green, and also inside the enclosure.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Amongst those present were:- Mr and Mrs D. Todd, Fallin; Mr and Mrs R. Wallace, Greenfields Colliery, Hamilton; Mr and Miss Wallace, Greenfields Colliery, Hamilton; Mr and Mrs Gibb, Tannochside Collieries, Uddingston; Mr McKay and Mr J. Young, Cornselloch Collieries, Larkhall; Mr and Mrs Inglis, Plean; Mr and Mrs Simmons, Cowie; Mr and Mrs Roberts, Carnock; Dr and Mrs Porter, Fallin; Mr, Mrs, and Miss Kinniburgh, Cowie; Mr W. Davidson, Plean; Messrs Cowley, and Robertson, Craigend, Polmont; Mr J. MIndoe, Whistleberry, Blantyre; Mr J. Walker, Hamilton; Mr A. Falconer, Hamilton; Mr, Mrs, and Master G. Stewart, Rosebank, Blantyre; Mr and Mrs H. Barr, Motherwell; Mr W. and Miss Kerr, Motherwell; Mr and Misses McLaren, Alton Farm, Bandeath; Mr and Mrs Carsewell, Dykes Farm; Mr and Miss Tweedie, Throsk; Messrs Hunter, Wylie, and MIntosh, of Messrs Hunter and Warren, Glasgow; Mr Shallon, Buchers and Company, Leith; Dr Laidlaw; Messrs T. Muir, J. Laidlaw, and Skea, Stirling; Messrs A. Hannah, Wright, and Steel, Denny; Mr and Mrs Kerr, Bandeath Farm; Mr U. Henderson and Miss Henderson, Burnbank, Throsk; Mr D.

Ferguson, Linden Avenue, Stirling; Mr Bryson, Cockspow Farm, etc.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Representatives were also present from Cowie, Bannockburn; Livilands, Borestone, Cambusbarron, Stirling, Spittalmyre, and Causewayhead Bowling Clubs.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>The new green which is situated at the side of the road opposite the houses at Fallin, was laid by Mr Provan, Rutherglen, whilst the inclosing wall and fence were erected by Mr G. Stewart, Blantyre. Both are excellent pieces of work. The green has cost £300, and the expense of erecting the wall was £90. The green was opened practically free of debt, but it is still without a bowlhouse, which is a very necessary adjunct, and this is to be provided from funds raised by the sale of work and other sources.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>It is expected that the Gothenburg Society Committee will assist in this matter after the first year's profit has declared on their institution. The officials of the bowling club are:- President, Mr D. Todd, colliery manager; Vice-president, Mr J. Barr, sen.; Secretary, Mr D. Blythe; Treasurer, Mr A. Kerr, and greenkeeper, Mr. R. Denovan. There are already 40 members.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>No function like Saturday's is complete without a photograph of the company being taken, and this having been done by Mr Bennet, St. Ninians, the opening ceremony in connection with the green was proceeded with.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Mr Todd, in introducing Mr Horne, said that that gentlemen had showed his goodwill and love for his native shire when he put himself to the inconvenience of coming all the way from Edinburgh that afternoon to open the first bowling green and sale of work held in the village of Fallin.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Mr Horne, who made a neat little speech, said it was the greatest possible pleasure for him to be present that day and see Fallin in gala costume, and to assist in the opening of a bowling green which would be of the greatest possible use in the way of outdoor recreation in the future. They had met under the best conditions in regard to the weather, and he began to wonder if in this respect the nose of the Coronation had not been somewhat put out of joint when they had such a beautiful day as they were experiencing. (Laughter and applause.) He congratulated them on having such a fine green for recreation on a summer evening.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Some form of amusement after the day's work was required, and they could realise how beneficent it was for the people of a small village like Fallin that they should have a form of sport in which every member of the community could take a part. Britain had led the way as a nation in sport. She had taught bowling, football, and cricket to the world, and in doing so they might congratulate themselves that in these things Britain had proved of the best possible service to mankind. Any sport such as bowling bred a healthy type of man among the people, and it was treating life as it ought to be treated that they should not have all work and no play.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>This was the spirit that animated Admiral Drake when he heard of the advent of the Spanish Armada on the English coast. He was playing bowls at the time, and when the news was brought to him of the enemy's appearance, he said they would finish their game, which he did, and then he went out and beat the Spaniards (Laughter and applause.) The new green would make the community of Fallin pure and better in every way, and the only thing he was uncertain of was that some of them might perhaps be so bent on playing bowls when they should be working on the night shift. (Laughter) They found themselves that day in a peculiarly happy situation.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Before him lay a beautiful green, and around him he saw such a scene as he thought could not be witnessed anywhere else, bordered as that scene was by the base of the most beautiful hills in one of the loveliest counties of Scotland. (Applause.)</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Mr Horne then formally declared the green open, and Mr Johnston Barr, sen. proposed a vote of thanks to Mr Horne.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Mr Todd next said he had much pleasure in calling upon Mrs Horne (Mr Horne's mother) to throw the first "jack."</p>
                                        
                                        <p>This lady did so, and managed to throw the "kitty" a very good length, amid applause. This over, Mrs Todd then formally presented Mrs Horne, on behalf of the club, with a silver jack, suitably inscribed, and placed on a stand.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Mr Horne made a brief reply on behalf of his mother and said that that gift was more than she or he had ever thought of. They would cherish the souvenir which had been presented to Mrs Horne, and he hoped that many "jacks" would be thrown in future years on the Fallin bowling green.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>On the invitation of Mr Johnston Barr, Mrs Todd then threw the first bowl, which was also a good length, and she was then presented with a silver "jack" by Mr Provan, the contractor for the green.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Mr Todd replied for his wife. The next part of the ceremony was the presenting of two silver cups and a set of gold badges to the club. The first cup was handed over by Mr Thallon, on behalf of Mr Buchers, Leith, and is for the single-banded championship; whilst the second trophy was presented by Dr Laidlaw, Stirling, and it will be played for by rinks. The Doctor also intimated that he would give a set of gold badges, to go to the members of the winning rink.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>Mr Todd returned thanks to the donors of the cup, and said these gifts would give every bowler in the green a chance of going in and winning something which he would look upon with regard in after years.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>It may be here stated that the club has equipped itself with bowls, but a gift was made to it of several mounted bowls from other gentlemen in the district.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>In concluding the proceedings, Mr Todd said that the green had been made and opened practically without there being a penny of debt on it, but the ladies thought they would like to assist in regard to the raising of the funds for a bowlhouse, and they had accordingly arranged to have a sale of work that afternoon in the recreation hall. The club had got on extra well so far through the aid of outside friends and subscriptions, and if the ladies did as well that afternoon everybody would be highly satisfied.</p>
                                        
                                        <h4>Match Results</h4>
                                        <p>A match then took place between teams selected by the President and Vice-President of the Club. Six rinks took part, and the result was as follows:-</p>

                                        <p>Whilst the enthusiastic bowlers then went to engage in a game between sides captained by the President and Vice-President, a large section of the company proceeded to the Hall, where Mr Horne opened the sale of work.</p>
                                        
                                        <p>He said that having had the benefit of seeing the green he was in a very fortunate position of being able to recommend the sale of work to everybody in the room. If people were to have bowling greens they had to pay for them. That was, unfortunately, the way of the world, and it was therefore necessary to raise the funds to provide this means of recreation in the district. It was a somewhat extraordinary result of human nature that they could never get so much from subscriptions as in the way of work, and that if they started a sale of work, especially amongst ladies, they could raise far more money than they could from subscriptions from the pockets of gentlemen. (Laughter)</p>
                                        
                                        <p>The ladies of Fallin believed it would be for the good of their husbands and families that this green should exist where it did and he was quite certain that every married woman expected her "man" to come home in the evening with the sweetest possible temper, and never to say a hard word-(laughter)-which would be a very good results of the establishment of the green in the district. (More laughter.) As they all knew every bowl had its bias, and the great success in bowling was only to be done by rolling up the bowl to the jack with the proper bias. He hoped that everybody present had got a strong bias in favour of the things they saw before them and the result would be that most of the debt, if not the whole of it, would to a large extent be wiped of by the evening. (Applause.) He then declared the sale open. The sale was a great success, and £85 was realised.</p>
